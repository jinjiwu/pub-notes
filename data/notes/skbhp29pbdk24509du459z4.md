> <abbr title="Neural Radiance Fields">NeRF</abbr> is a technique used in computer graphics and computer vision that aims to generate realistic 3D scenes from 2D images or a limited set of 2D views. It is particularly effective in creating high-quality renderings of complex scenes with detailed lighting and geometry. <div style="text-align: right"> (come frome chatGPT) </div>
