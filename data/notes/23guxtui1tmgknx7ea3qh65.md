## Example

> We reduce this cost with a **versatile** new input encoding that permits the use of a smaller network without **sacrificing** quality, thus significantly reducing the number of floating point and memory access operations. 
> - 多才多艺的. 

> This approach tends to yield a larger degree of adaptivity compared with the previous parametric encodings, **albeit** at greater computational cost which can only be amortized when sufficiently many inputs x fall into each leaf node.
> - Although.

> which have **on the order of** 10 000 entries. 
> - About.

> Without interpolation, **grid-aligned discontinuities** would be present in the network output, which would result in an **undesirable blocky appearance**
> - 网格不连续，会有空洞
